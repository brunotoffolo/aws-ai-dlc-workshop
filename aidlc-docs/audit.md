## Units Generation - Architectural Change Request
**Timestamp**: 2026-02-10T17:39:13Z

**User Input**: "did you test the infrastructure (unit 1) or just delivered me any garbate you put out?"
**AI Response**: Ran npm install, tsc --noEmit (passed), cdk synth (failed — Lambda code paths referenced non-existent backend dirs). Fixed: (1) ApiStack Lambda code now uses inline placeholder when backend code doesn't exist yet, (2) Fixed deprecated pointInTimeRecovery → pointInTimeRecoverySpecification. Re-ran tsc (passed) and cdk synth (passed — all 6 stacks synthesised successfully).
