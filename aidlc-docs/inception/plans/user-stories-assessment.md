# User Stories Assessment

## Request Analysis
- **Original Request**: On-demand tutorial platform with multi-agent AI architecture for auto-generating curriculum, educational materials, quizzes/tests, accreditation, and LinkedIn integration
- **User Impact**: Direct — multiple user-facing features (learning, testing, credentialing, social sharing)
- **Complexity Level**: Complex — multi-agent system, multiple user workflows, external integrations, adaptive personalisation
- **Stakeholders**: Corporate learners, training administrators, platform operators

## Assessment Criteria Met

### High Priority (ALWAYS Execute)
- [x] New User Features: Entirely new platform with multiple user-facing capabilities
- [x] User Experience Changes: Multiple distinct user workflows (onboarding, learning, testing, credentialing, LinkedIn sharing)
- [x] Multi-Persona Systems: At minimum learners and administrators
- [x] Complex Business Logic: Adaptive learning paths, content generation pipelines, credential issuance, grading
- [x] Customer-Facing APIs: Platform serves end-users directly

### Medium Priority (Also Applicable)
- [x] Integration Work: LinkedIn API integration affects user workflow
- [x] Data Changes: User progress, credentials, learning analytics
- [x] Security Enhancements: OAuth for LinkedIn, user authentication

## Decision
**Execute User Stories**: Yes
**Reasoning**: This is a complex, multi-persona platform with numerous user-facing features, multiple distinct user journeys (onboarding → learning → testing → credentialing → LinkedIn sharing), and adaptive AI-driven interactions. User stories are essential to define clear acceptance criteria, ensure comprehensive coverage of user workflows, and establish testable specifications for each agent's user-facing behaviour.

## Expected Outcomes
- Clear definition of user personas (learner, admin) and their goals
- Structured user journeys from topic selection through credential sharing
- Testable acceptance criteria for each feature
- Prioritised story backlog aligned with MVP scope
- Shared understanding of adaptive learning and personalisation behaviour
